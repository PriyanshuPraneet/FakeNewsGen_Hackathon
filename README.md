# FakeNewsGen Hackathon Project
This project was developed as part of the USELESS PROJECTS Hackathon organized by TinkerHub. The objective was to create a fake news generator that produces humorous and obviously fabricated news articles.

Project Description
The Fake News Generator leverages the GEMINI API to generate prompts, which in turn produce three amusing and clearly fictitious news articles. The responses from the API are fetched and displayed on the frontend.
